1. Add a button resetting the state to `0`. It should leverage an action "RESET".
2. Change the reducer so that the reducer expects a property `value` on the action. This should be the amount by how much the number is incremented. Update the callback dispatching the `increment` action to provide this value.
3. Create a 4th button incrementing the value by 10.
